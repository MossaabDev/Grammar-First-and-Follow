# Grammar-First-and-Follow
This program finds Firsts and Follows for every symbol in a given grammar.
This is a desktop application with Java UI Swing, allows you to enter a grammar, then it gives you firsts and follows of the nonTerminal symbols used in the rules of the grammar.
# How To Use This Application
There are two parts of the program, one for symbols declaration (Terminal and nonTerminal), and second for rules of the grammar.
## Symbols
You should declare all the symbols of the grammar, and define the type of the symbol as well (t: Terminal, n_t: nonTerminal).
